					# Internet of Dingus
					Ryan Parsley
					Notes:
            I hope to demistify the internet of things by creating an example to illustrate all the parts that make it work.

					> The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure. &mdash;[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

					Notes:
						Go ahead, soak that up. So, a thing can be a device, or a car, or an apliance or... well... anything.
						Maybe the next line clears it up. Sensor (input), acutators (output) and connectivity (internet).
						Uniquely Identifiable
						Able to inter-operate withing the existing internet infrastructure.

						* Sensors (Input)
						* Acutators (output)
						* Uniquely Identifiable
						* Connectivity (internet).
						* Able to inter-operate withing the existing internet infrastructure. (yes, *that* internet)

						Note:
						* Sensors can be buttons or components that sense thinks like heat, humidity, light, proximity
						* Acutators can be thought of as components that create output. Motors, Speakers, lights, relays.
						* Uniquely Identifiable, we need to know which thing we're talking too or hearing from.
						* The last two go together. The "thing" needs to be on the internet and not in too novel of a way.

					# Enter the dingus
					Note:
					A dingus is... a kind of a thing. For the rest of this talk, when I say "dingus" I'm talking about this hardware profile.

				<section data-markdown>
					## A Dingus
					![A Dingus](img/dingus.png)

					Note:
					A dingus has:
					* Wifi
					* One actuator
					* One sensor

					The reference dingus is a Huzzah Feather from a company called Adafruit. It's compatible with Arduino, but has wifi built in.

					## Internet of Dingus
					![Internet of Dingus](img/internetOfDingus.jpg)

					Note:
					3 servers come together to provide a specific piece of the puzzle.

					Each dingus only interacts with one of the servers directly.

					You don't *need* this level of separation, but I think it helps distil the conversation.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Drupal backend
					* Plain ol' web services
					* Decoupled (headless) CMS
					* Enables users to register a dingus and add meta data around it.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Drupal Dingus API
					```
					{
						id: "39269531-32df-4e16-a81c-13b7fd3860bf",
						attributes: {
							status: true,
							title: "Lightbulb 1",
							created: 1522939362,
							changed: 1523906146,
							body: { value: "<p>Hello Dingus!</p>" },
							field_chip_id: 1085074
						}
					}

					## WTF is MQTT!?

				<section data-markdown>
					## WTF is MQTT!?
					The de facto way to have things talk amongst themsleves.

					* Publisher(s)
					* Subscriber(s)
					* Broker

					Note:
					It's a standard way of enabling publishing and subscribing messages.

					If you think about MQTT as chat for things, the broker is the buddy list.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## The Frontend
					![Frontend](img/Internet_of_Dingus_view.png)

					Note:
					The frontend ties together realtime data from MQTT to the less dynamic meta data served via API that Drupal is responsible.

					# All this to turn on a lightbulb!?

					Note:
					That's just the start. Any pairing of sensor and acutator works on this system

					* Turn on a fan when it gets too hot
					* Sound an alarm if the keg gets too light
					* Water a plant if it gets too dry
